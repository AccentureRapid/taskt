taskt is a free, open-source, and easy-to-use robotic process automation client built on the .NET Framework in C#.  taskt allows you to build a digital workforce and automate straight-forward and repetative actions with ease.  Included is a WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) designer with dozens of automation commands and options as well as a screen recorder that records and replays scripted automation. With taskt, you can spend less time writing code and more time configuring functionality.

# How does taskt work?
taskt works by essentially building and executing XML command instructions.  Each automation command has an independent definition and parameters that are required for command execution.  Bot Developers chain the commands together using a rich user interface to create an automation script.

# What can taskt do?
taskt can perform automation on Web Applications as well as standard, thick-client applications.  Taskt can start and stop processes, launch VB and PowerShell scripts, work directly with Excel workbooks, and perform OCR (OneNote installation required) among many other functions.  You can review all the automation commands by clicking [here](https://github.com/saucepleez/taskt/wiki/Automation-Commands).
